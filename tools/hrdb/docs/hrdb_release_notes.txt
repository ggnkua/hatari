hrdb Release Notes
==================

v0.006 (February 2022)

- Hardware Window
  - Rewrite view to support Macs better
  - Show exception, interrupt, MFP vectors
  - Show some DMA sound registers
  - All addresses support right-click menus to e.g. open disassembly views at interrupt addresses
  - Add "copy to clipboard" button (for easier offline state comparison)
  - Add tooltips for most row types

- Memory Window
  - smarter handling of "S" (step) key when editing memory

- Main Window
  - Add "Shift+S" to skip over the current instruction without executing it
    (request from Troed/SYNC)

- Diassembly Window
  - Add "Set PC to here" right-click menu action
    (request from Troed/SYNC)

- Run Dialog
  - Support capitalized file extensions for executable (e.g. ".PRG" files as well as ".prg")

- Hatari (target runtime)
  - Fix display of many fields in Hardware view by making Hatari sync hardware register address data after stopping
    (e.g. Blitter register, video display counter)


v0.005 (December 2021)

- Disassembly view
  - Fix color settings with Mac Dark Theme. (reported by RATI/OVR)
  - New design for row highlighting. Suggested by RATI/OVR.
    - PC row is main highlight colours (usually white-on-blue for light themes)
    - Active Cursor row uses dashed lines
    - Mouseover row is a different background colour (palette "midlight" value)
  - Window limits movement of the address when Follow PC is active.
    - Code tries to keep the window static until PC moves out of visible range,
      this allows you to see the code around the PC in a more stable fashion.

- Memory Window
  - Fixed bug when Lock button is changed. If Lock was applied, window wouldn't re-fetch memory data because of a typo.
    (reported by RATI/OVR)
  - Fixed another bug with locked expressions.
      View was requesting memory for the window before register values arrived,
      so was always behind by a step.

- Graphics Inspector
  - Add "Save Image" right-click context menu item for easier sprite/gfx ripping.
    Image is saved as a palettised BMP or PNG using Qt's image libraries.
    (requested by Shazz/TRSI)

- General
  - New feature: support e.g. "D0.W" for sign-extended data registers when evaluating expressions.

- Hatari (Target runtime)
  - Fix crash bug in RemoteDebug.c's DebugOutput redirection handling.
